                    <p class="my-3">The College of Management at Fu Jen Catholic University traces its roots to a business curriculum launched in 1963 through the Department of Industry and Business Management, renamed the Department of Business Administration the following year, and located within the College of Law. The curriculum and organization evolved over the years, leading to the establishment of the College of Business in 1969 and then the College of Management (a.k.a. FJCM) renamed in 1982. The college comprises five departments, one graduate institute, and six program units offering undergraduate, master's, and doctoral degree programs. For the Academic Year 2023-24, the student enrollment numbers for these programs are 3,120 for undergraduate, 778 for master's, and 76 for doctoral levels, respectively.</p>
                    <div class="collapse" id="collapseMaIntro">
                        <p class="my-3">The gender ratio is 45:55, with males comprising 45% and females 55% of the student body. Approximately 5% of the total student population are international students, and 65% of overseas students are undergraduates. The five major departments offer a comprehensive coverage of current disciplines in business and management education. This includes foundational areas such as accounting, often regarded as the cornerstone of business; advanced fields like finance, and disciplines vital for today's technological trends such as statistics and information management for big data, AI, and IoT. Additionally, the college cultivates talent in management capable of effective coordination and communication across these diverse disciplines.</p>

                <div class="justify-text">
                    <p class="my-3">FJCM is the only business school in the Great China Region supported by the Jesuits, whose philosophy attracts and retains many faculty members who strongly believe in ethics, social responsibility, and social justice and are willing to achieve our educational goals together. Accordingly, it has developed a unique mission statement among business schools.</p>
                    <p class="my-3">Based on the whole-person educational philosophy of Fu Jen Catholic University, the College of Management intends to help students develop into the intelligent and ethical managers needed by modern society.</p>
                    <p class="my-3">To cultivate intelligent, ethical managers, the College emphasizes learning by doing, producing scholarship, employing diverse pedagogical methods, and serving humankind.</p>
                    <div class="collapse" id="collapseMaFeatu">
                        <p class="my-3">The College abides by its four core values: to cultivate human-centric values, to enhance resource integration, to produce innovative knowledge, and to instill a global mindset in students. Through the joint efforts of faculty, staff, and students, the College aims to establish a sound learning environment and become a role model for higher education in the field of management.</p>
                        <p class="my-3">One of the College's major advantages lies in its participation in the international accreditation process facilitated by The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business-International (AACSB), starting in 2005.  The college is scheduled to undergo its fourth AACSB Continuous Improvement Review (CIR) in March 2025. Furthermore, as an institution founded by the Society of Jesus, the College underscores its distinctive educational character through its affiliation with the International Association of Jesuit Business Schools (IAJBS). Through these platforms, the College has cultivated various forms of collaboration with peer institutions both domestically and abroad. By engaging in mutual exchange, this initiative aims to enhance Fu Jen Catholic University's visibility, expand opportunities for attracting diverse, high-quality students, and broaden the international perspectives of faculty and students.</p>
                        <p>As part of Fu Jen Catholic University, a comprehensive institution with 12 colleges, students within the College of Management have ample opportunities to pursue secondary areas of specialization or engage in interdisciplinary studies. Currently, 12 interdisciplinary programs (further detail referring to the next section) are available, providing students with broad career prospects.</p>
                        <p>The development of numerous interdisciplinary programs manifests FJCM’s commitment to balancing theoretical knowledge with practical application. Through undergraduate capstone projects, students are equipped with the ability to conduct independent research and practical operations, fostering lifelong skills that alumni often express gratitude for upon returning to the university.</p>
                        <p>The twenty-two-degree programs are structured across five departments, one graduate institute, and four autonomous program units that are introduced as follows.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Business Administration provides education at the undergraduate and master’s levels. The BBA program is very popular and its diverse courses attract international students both for degree-seeking purposes as well as through exchange programs. In total, one-tenth of the students in the program are from overseas. The department collaborates closely with industry, producing case studies and arranging business visits, thereby fostering closer interaction between faculty, students, and the business community.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Accounting provides education at the undergraduate and master’s levels. As part of the department’s commitment to “learning by doing”, all seniors must complete research projects within a team to graduate.  Since 2000, the Department has worked with the Taxation Bureau by providing services to the local community in filing income-tax returns. Graduates hold leadership positions in the accounting profession, as well as in academia, government, and the business community. In January 2016, Certified Practicing Accountants Australia (CPA Australia) officially recognized the degrees the Department of Accounting conferred. Graduates of the department are now eligible to apply for “Associate” membership through CPA Australia, meaning they can receive an exemption from CPA Australia’s 6 foundation exams.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Statistics and Information Science (the Department of Statistics before its renaming in 2001) provides education at the undergraduate and master’s levels. The Department has been a pioneer in Taiwan regarding the combination of statistics and information science. The Development remains current by offering courses in the most popular and innovative technology, such as Big Data and AI. These courses have also attracted many undergraduates from other programs and colleges on campus. With the campus near four of the six major industrial zones located in New Taipei City, the Department has kept up with the latest trends, while actively developing ties with the local business community.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Finance and International Business (originally set up as the Department of International Trade in 1973, renamed as the Department of International Trade and Finance in 1998, and its current incarnation since 2010) provides education at the undergraduate and master’s levels. The curriculum is designed to combine two popular professions - finance and international business - and train world-class entrepreneurial talent for finance and management.   The Department has signed cooperative agreements with more than 20 enterprises in the financial sectors. For example, launched in 2013, the internship program with Xiamen Bank Co. Ltd in China made the Department the first in Taiwan to offer a cross-strait internship program. Up to now, more than 20 students participated in internship courses abroad annually, on average, except for the years affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Information Management, established in 1981, was the first of its kind in Taiwan. As a pioneer in the IT field since its early years, the Department consistently played a leadership role, while boosting digital transformation when it comes to AI, big data, and cloud computing. The department has prioritized cultivating a culture of "learning by doing," employing mechanisms such as online assessments and project implementation to facilitate hands-on learning. It aims to nurture professionals in the development of AI applications and cloud services. In addition to offering core and elective courses, the department provides practical programs such as "E-commerce," "Trends in Cloud Services," and "AI Micro-programs" to enable students to pursue interdisciplinary learning and develop secondary expertise.</p>
                        <p>The Graduate Institute of Business Administration, established in 2002, solely provides the PhD program. The doctoral program has since been defined as an integrated PhD Program and is anticipated to become a PhD Program in both theories and practice. It emphasizes enhancing management and professional skills as well as humanities and ethics within context. It also creates a cooperation platform for the school and industry to guide research directions with experiences and reinforce the scope and effects of experience impacts on research. Four fields are available for students to choose to meet their professional needs: 1) General Management & Management Science Field, 2) Finance (incl. Accounting) Field, 3) Information Management Field, and 4) Hospital Management Field with the supporting faculty from the College of Medicine.</p>
                        <p>The MBA program in International Management (imMBA) was established as the MBA in Business Management in 2006. The program was reorganized and renamed in 2011 to enhance students’ international management capabilities. To ensure that students are internationally mobile, all courses taught in imMBA have been offered exclusively in English since 2014.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Master of Social Enterprise program (E/W) was established in 2013. At the time, courses were offered during evenings and weekends, but daytime courses were added during AY2016-17. The program aims to practice Catholic values while nurturing social entrepreneurs was the very first degree program in social enterprise in the Greater China region.  Students actively engaged in local or global community engagement, with their endeavors spanning across Mongolia, Africa, rural China (Qinghai, Yunnan, Shanxi, etc.), and southeastern Asia.</p>

To monitor the relevance of the course, all course instructors are required to fill out the core abilities including skills and attitude, and knowledge based on the O*NET program. The AoL system of FJCM also adopted the skills and knowledge as the foundation of competency. The figure below shows the relationship and linkage in the AoL system (taking the BBA program in Business Administration, for example).
