                    <p class="my-3">The College of Management at Fu Jen Catholic University traces its roots to a business curriculum launched in 1963 through the Department of Industry and Business Management, renamed the Department of Business Administration the following year, and located within the College of Law. The curriculum and organization evolved over the years, leading to the establishment of the College of Business in 1969 and then the College of Management (a.k.a. FJCM) renamed in 1982. The College comprises five departments, one graduate institute, and six program units offering undergraduate, master's, and doctoral degree programs.</p>

                        <p class="my-3">For the Academic Year 2023-24, the student enrollment numbers for these programs are 3,120 for undergraduate, 778 for master's, and 76 for doctoral levels, respectively. The gender ratio is 45:55, with males comprising 45% and females 55% of the student body. Approximately 5% of the total student population are international students, and 65% of overseas students are undergraduates.</p>

                <div class="justify-text">
                    <p class="my-3">FJCM is the only business school in the Great China Region supported by the Catholics, whose philosophy attracts and retains faculty members who strongly believe in ethics, social responsibility, and social justice and are willing to achieve our educational goals together. Accordingly, it has developed a unique mission statement among business schools. </p>
                    <p class="my-3">Based on the holistic educational philosophy of Fu Jen Catholic University, the College of Management intends to help students develop into the intelligent and ethical managers needed by modern society. To cultivate intelligent and ethical managers, the College emphasizes learning by doing, producing scholarship, employing diverse pedagogical methods, and serving humankind. </p>
                    <div class="collapse" id="collapseMaFeatu">
                        <p class="my-3">The College abides by its four core values: to cultivate human-centric values, to enhance resource integration, to produce innovative knowledge, and to instill a global mindset in students. Through the joint efforts of faculty, staff, and students, the College aims to establish a sound learning environment and become a role model for higher education in management.</p>
                        <p class="my-3">One of the College's major advantages lies in its participation in the international accreditation process facilitated by The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business-International (AACSB), starting in 2005.  The College is scheduled to undergo its fourth AACSB Continuous Improvement Review (CIR) in March 2025. Furthermore, as an institution founded by the Society of Jesus, the College underscores its distinctive educational character through its affiliation with the International Association of Jesuit Business Schools (IAJBS). Through these platforms, the College has cultivated various forms of collaboration with peer institutions both domestically and abroad. By engaging in mutual exchange, this initiative aims to enhance Fu Jen Catholic University's visibility, expand opportunities for attracting diverse, high-quality students, and broaden the international perspectives of faculty and students.</p>
                        <p>The College of Management stands out for its strong emphasis on internationalization, particularly its full English instruction courses and bilingual education initiatives. Starting from 2021, recognized as a benchmark institution by the Ministry of Education, the College’s Bi-lingual Center received substantial funding to enhance students' English proficiency in all 4 skills. Additionally, the Center is focused on boosting teachers' instructional capabilities to align with Taiwan's 2030 Bilingual Nation policy.</p>
                        <p>The College’s international reach extends through its imMBA dual-degree programs with universities in the United States, Spain, and France, offering students the opportunity to gain global perspectives. Furthermore, the College’s 4+1 Bridge Program, in collaboration with five U.S. universities, provides undergraduate students with a seamless pathway to obtaining both a bachelor’s degree from Fu Jen and a master’s degree from a prestigious American institution in just five years. This initiative has become a cornerstone for students pursuing advanced studies abroad.</p>
                        <p>FJCM’s twenty-two-degree programs are structured across five departments, one graduate institute, and four independent programs, which are introduced as follows.</p>
                        <ul class="decimal-list">
                            <li>The Department of Business Administration provides education at the undergraduate and master’s levels. In total, one-tenth of the students in the program are from overseas. The department collaborates closely with industry, producing case studies and arranging business visits, fostering closer interaction between faculty, students, and the business community</li>    
                            <li>The Department of Accounting provides education at the undergraduate and master’s levels. As part of the department’s commitment to “learning by doing”, all seniors must complete research projects within a team to graduate. In January 2016, Certified Practicing Accountants Australia (CPA Australia) officially recognized the degrees the Department of Accounting conferred. </li>
                            <li>The Department of Statistics and Information Science provides education at the undergraduate and master’s levels. The Department has been a pioneer in Taiwan regarding the combination of statistics and information science. The Development remains current by offering courses in the most popular and innovative technology, such as Big Data and AI.</li>
                            <li>The Department of Finance and International Business provides education at the undergraduate and master’s levels. The curriculum is designed to combine two popular professions - finance and international business - and train world-class entrepreneurial talent for finance and management. The Department has signed cooperative agreements with more than 20 enterprises in the financial sectors.</li>
                            <li>The Department of Information Management, established in 1981, was the pioneer in the IT field since its early years. The Department consistently played a leadership role while boosting digital transformation in AI, big data, and cloud computing. In addition to offering core and elective courses, the department provides practical programs such as "E-commerce," "Trends in Cloud Services," and "AI Micro-programs" to enable students to pursue interdisciplinary learning and develop secondary expertise.</li>
                            <li>The Graduate Institute of Business Administration, established in 2002, solely provides the PhD program. The doctoral program has since been defined as an integrated PhD Program and is anticipated to become a PhD Program in both theories and practice.</li>
                            <li>The MBA program in International Management (imMBA) was established as the MBA in Business Management in 2006. To ensure that students are internationally mobile, all courses taught in imMBA have been offered exclusively in English since 2014.</li>
                            <li>The Master of Social Enterprise program (E/W) was established in 2013. At the time, courses were offered during evenings and weekends, but daytime courses were added during AY2016-17. The program aims to practice Catholic values while nurturing social entrepreneurs. It was the first-degree program in social enterprise in Greater China.</li>
