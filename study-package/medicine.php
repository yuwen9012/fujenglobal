                    <p class="my-3">To prepare health care professionals who respect life, are passionate in their service of others, demonstrate breadth of vision and strong motivation for learning, and are proficient in knowledge and medical skills.</p>
                    <p class="my-3 fw-semibold" style="text-decoration: underline">Vision</p>
                    <p class="my-3">To achieve excellence as an educational institution in the science and art of medicine.</p>
                    <p class="my-3 fw-semibold" style="text-decoration: underline">Short and Mid-term Goals</p>
                    <p class="my-3">To foster high-quality students: Under the impact of the declining growth rate in Taiwan, it is important that the university can continue to educate high-quality professionals to sustain the development of the country. The goal will be achieved by the following strategies:</p>
                    <p class="my-3">(1) To reinforce student recruitment through diversified entrance channels so that the College can have students with a solid background in humanities, the enthusiasm to serve society, the spirit of teamwork, and a strong sense of empathy.</p>
                    <p class="my-3">(2) To revamp the curriculum by making the most of the extensive classes of a comprehensive university and implement interdisciplinary programs, such as medical humanities and psychological counseling.</p>
                    <p class="my-3">(3) To strengthen the PBL pedagogy through fostering tutors and compiling case studies to manifest the essence of PBL. The pedagogy is supplemented by traditional approaches of teaching to help students construct a well-structured knowledge system and its application so that they can diagnose accurately in clinical practice.</p>
                    <p class="my-3">(4) Besides professional knowledge and technical skills, value and moral education are key to preparing high-quality medical and public health staff. To enhance the values education of the students through constructing a healthy attitude toward life through a humanistic curriculum, encouraging students’ participation in service-learning activities organized by the university and the college, and offering guidance and psychological counseling for students when needed so that students’ EQ can be elevated.</p>
                    <p class="my-3">(5) To strive for internationalization by engaging in actual exchanges with renowned universities worldwide and international student recruitment. Through exposure to different cultures, students can better serve in the globalized world.</p>
                    <p class="my-3">(6) To coordinate teaching, research, and service amongst different departments so that they can focus on areas highlighted by the College, including geriatrics, health care for seniors, sleeping disorders, and care. The College emphasizes teamwork between the clinical and basic tracts as well as interdisciplinary cooperation.</p>
                    <p class="my-3">(7) To encourage community service. The College promotes community engagement so that students learn to shoulder their social responsibility while at the same time helping improve the health of the general public in the neighboring community.</p>
                    <p class="my-3">(8) To assist in the planning and management of the affiliated hospital. Fu Jen Catholic University Hospital is the most important investment of the university after its re-establishment in Taiwan. The building of the hospital can bring all the potentiality of interdisciplinary cooperation on teaching and research between different colleges into full play, especially the College of Science and Engineering, College of Human Ecology, College of Management, and College of Arts. It will also sharpen the competitive edge of the College of Medicine among her peers. Professors of the College are invited to serve on the Preparatory Committee for Fu Jen Catholic University Hospital and work on upgrading the hospital to the scale of a medical center. The College also invigorates her partnership with the current three teaching hospitals to form a strategic affiliation.</p>

                    <p class="my-3">Population aging is one of the great achievements of human development in the 21st century, and it is also the biggest challenge facing it. According to the latest estimates of the "Demography from 2010 to 2060" released by the Economic Construction Committee of the Executive Yuan in September 2010, it is expected that by 2017 The population aged 65 and above accounts for 14% of the total population, reaching what is called an aged society by international conventions and international organizations such as the United Nations.</p>
                    <div class="collapse" id="collapseMedFeatu">
                        <p class="my-3">It will increase to 20% in 2025, entering the so-called super-aged society. super-aged society). The impact of the rapid aging population structure is not only reflected in medical care, but also in the living environment. It has also caused new demands and problems. Population aging has become the focus of global attention. How to establish a healthy aging social environment so that the elderly can maintain dignity and living an independent life is a serious challenge.</p>
                        <p class="my-3">In order to achieve the spirit of respecting God and loving people and the school goals of holistic education, coupled with the spirit of our school motto "Truth, Goodness, Beauty, and Holiness" and the concept of respecting and caring for life, our school has successively taken many measures to respond. In terms of courses, there are medicine. The college planned and implemented the "Geriatrics Course" in 2005 in conjunction with relevant institutes on campus. In 2008, the "Long-term Care Credit Course for the Elderly" was established, and the "Elderly Health Promotion Teacher Community" was established in 2010, with teachers as the community. This teacher community is based on the fields of medicine, nursing, nutrition, cognitive science and social science, and integrates the expertise of teachers in various departments who are interested in geriatric teaching, research or service across fields. Sharing in the group allows experts in various fields inside and outside the school to understand each other's expertise and find mutual connections. In addition to promoting the improvement of teachers' own knowledge, it can also establish a basis for mutual teaching and research cooperation, increase the scope of research, and enhance Academic breadth and depth.</p>
                        <p class="my-3">Taiwan is about to become the fastest aging country. In line with the "Ten-Year Plan for Long-term Care" and the gradually developing national policies such as the "Long-term Care Services Act" and the "Long-term Care Insurance Act", Taiwan will need a large number of long-term care professionals in the short term. Our school is a comprehensive university and has a medical school. It upholds the spirit of "Truth, Benevolence and Beauty" and attaches great importance to humanistic care and social services. Since the 1994 academic year, it has launched a credit-based program in gerontology, and in the 1997 academic year, it has launched a credit-based master's degree program in long-term care. Years of experience and achievements in cultivating talents for the elderly and long-term care. Therefore, the cross-disciplinary long-term care master's degree program was launched in the 101 academic year. It adheres to the core values of "respecting the meaning and value of life", "holistic care" and "service mission", and uses the diverse and rich faculty and academic freedom to flourish. The campus culture connects local resources, strengthens cooperation and pragmatic development, and provides students with the benefits of enriching their creations and deepening their community.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3 ">Cognitive neuroscience is the field of study focusing on the neural substrates of mental processes. It is at the intersection of psychology and neuroscience, but also overlaps with physiological psychology, cognitive psychology and neuropsychology. In this paper reading course, the lecturer would first present a series of literatures covering contemporary research topics in cognitive neuroscience during the first half of the semester, and the students will have to make presentations with the assigned literatures in the second half of the semester. In addition to the presentation, discussion and interaction with the speakers are also valued in this course. Through this way, students could get a deep understanding of this research field.</p>
